## Hi there, I'm Vishakha Pathak <img src="https://media.tenor.com/kQcGDGtb79QAAAAi/alice-animated-alice-stickers.gif" width="70" />

## üöÄ About Me
I am a passionate Data Scientist with a deep interest in using data to solve complex problems and make informed decisions. With a background in Computer Science and Data Science, I specialize in leveraging machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization to derive actionable insights and help businesses drive growth.

## üî≠ Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
### Data Analysis
- **[Project 1](https://github.com/VishakhaPathak98/Pizza_Sales_Report)**:Created a dashboard to analyze the maximum sales for each pizza category and the top-selling pizza sizes over the course of one year. The dashboard provides insights into monthly and weekly trends. Tech Stack Used:-Excel ,SQL, Power Bi.


### Data Visualization
- **[Project 2](https://github.com/VishakhaPathak98/Road-Accident-Analysis)**: The objective of road accident analysis using Excel is to derive meaningful insights from collected data on road accidents. By employing various Excel features, the analysis aims to identify trends, patterns, and contributing factors to enhance road safety measures.

### Data Science
- **[Project 3](https://github.com/VishakhaPathak98/Bank-Loan-Prediction)**: The problem is to develop a predictive model that can assess whether a customer is eligible for a loan based on their financial and personal information. This helps lenders automate and streamline the loan approval process, improve decision-making accuracy, and reduce manual efforts.
  
- **[Project 4](https://github.com/VishakhaPathak98/Travel_Itinerary)**: A Travel Itinerary Chatbot is a virtual assistant designed to help users plan and organize their trips. It allows travelers to easily create personalized itineraries by suggesting destinations, activities, accommodations, and transportation based on user preferences. The chatbot can also provide real-time weather updates and answer travel-related queries, making trip planning more efficient and enjoyable.
